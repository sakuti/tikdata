# TikData

Data archiving tool that extracts TikTok user data into JSON for offline storage and analysis. It allows users to export their liked videos and other interaction data into structured JSON files for offline storage, analysis, and categorization.

## Features

- Export TikTok liked videos as JSON
- Works with short-lived session tokens as there is no public APIs available
- Easy-to-follow setup for beginner programmers ([Setup Instructions](./SETUP.md))

## Notice

This version of TikData is an early prototype. Currently, it only supports the test command, which verifies that your environment is set up correctly and that TikTok data can be retrieved. There will be more features soon. The test command does not download or archive full datasets yet. <u>Future versions will include full liked video export, categorization, and local JSON storage.</u>
